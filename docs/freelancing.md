i'm a freelance software developer. i make web sites and mobile apps and server backends.

I design, code, test, document, and deploy software situations.

* I've supported missions and initiatives in the private sector, the public sector, contracting, consulting, freelancing, and things in between all that.

* I can comfortably say that the fruits of my software development labor have been consumed by at least 3/4 of a Billion people around the planet.

So like... all that's cool. I guess. At least, to me, at one point in my life.
